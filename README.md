GeoAggregation

PROBLEM: A project I worked on used artificial geographical groupings for organizing activities and reporting.  Because these groupings were unique to our contract and not aligned with the Ministry of Health or Government organization we needed to group them ourselves in order to calculate routine indicator data for project management and reporting. 

AKA: Initial grouping and aggregation for routine calculations and reporting.

DESCRIPTION and USE: This is a general program to combine groups of data into smaller groups.  It is not limited to geographical groupings.  It can be modified easily.
